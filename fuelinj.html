Over time, fuel injectors develop a build-up of varnish and carbon.  Periodic
professional cleaning of the injectors will help to maintain engine performance and maximize fuel mileage.

<h3>Turnaround Time</h3>

<p>After over 30 years of servicing injectors as a full time job, I've decided it's time to take a step back and relax a little bit. Have no fear, I'm not closing up shop completely. I'll still be working part time; however, now it will be on a much more relaxed schedule.</p>

<p>If you are looking for parts for your injectors, I have a large inventory of replacement parts and have assembled parts kits for various injectors. These kits are available for purchase <a href="https://store.cruzinperformance.com/">in my store</a>. I will be adding more as time allows.</p>

<p>If you have injectors in need of service, please contact me by phone or email and I'll let you know my current availability.
