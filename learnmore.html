<p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></p>

<b>What happens during the testing and cleaning process?</b>
<blockquote><a href='injsteps.html'>Click here</a> to see a step-by-step pictorial explanation of the fuel injector cleaning process.</blockquote>

<b>How should I prepare my injectors for safe shipment?</b>

<blockquote><a href="/packaging">Click here</a> for instructions on how to package your injectors for shipment.</blockquote>

<b>What is the turn-around time?</b>
<blockquote>The turn-around time for servicing your injectors depends on several factors.  These include: the type of injector being sent for service, the condition of the injectors, the current backlog of injectors in the shop, and also the method of shipping used.  Please call or <a href='mailto:rich@cruzinperformance.com'>e-mail</a> for the current turn-around time.  This will help with my scheduling of the servicing of your injectors.  Failure to contact me prior to shipping your injectors may delay their turn-around time.  Please keep in mind that this is not a factory.  I am too "anal" to let anyone else service the injectors, and I personally perform all of the work on the injectors that are sent for service.</blockquote>

<b>Will you notify me when my injectors arrive?</b>

<blockquote>
UPS and FedEx provide tracking services for this purpose.  Delivery confirmation and tracking services are available from the U.S. Postal Service for packages shipped with them.  I will notify you when I have finished servicing your injectors and have them ready to return.
</blockquote>

<b>Can you charge the shipping to my UPS or FedEx account?</b>

<blockquote>If you have a UPS or FedEx account and would like the return shipping billed to your account, please include your shipping account number or a return shipping label with your injectors.</blockquote>

<b>Can I include a pre-paid return shipping label with my injectors?</b>
<blockquote>Absolutely.  I do not "mark-up" the shipping cost or profit from return shipping of your injectors.  If you would like to include a pre-paid return shipping label from your carrier of choice, you may do so.  Please include it in the package with your injectors.

<p>
<span style="color:red">NOTE: Please do NOT send stamps to cover the postage.</span>  If you send stamps, then they will be returned to you, and you will be charged the actual return postage.
</p></blockquote>

<b>What payment methods do you accept?</b>
<blockquote>
<li>Credit cards accepted via <a href='http://www.paypal.com/'>PayPal.com</a>
<li>Money order, cashier's check, business check, or personal check
<li>Please <a href="mailto:rich@cruzinperformance.com">e-mail me</a> your return mailing address prior to shipping your injectors for a total cost with return shipping.
</blockquote>

<b>Can you "flow match" or "balance" my injectors?</b>

<blockquote>The flow rate of the injectors cannot be changed or adjusted.  In order to make a balanced or matched set of injectors, you need to start with more injectors than are needed for your application.  All of the injectors would be cleaned and tested.  Then, the injectors that flow closest to each other are grouped in sets according to their flow.  This, in essence, makes a "matched" set.</blockquote>

<b>Will you modify my injectors to flow more?</b>

<blockquote>In a word, NO.  Injectors are manufactured to flow a precise amount of fuel.  From past experience of testing injectors that have been "modified" to flow more than they were intended to flow, results have shown that they may become very inconsistent in their flow volume.  This results in poor idle quality, drivability issues, higher emissions, and possible engine damage.  If you find that you require an injector that flows more fuel, the best solution is to purchase an injector that was manufactured to flow more fuel.</blockquote>

<b>What is the "shelf life" of injectors that have been cleaned?</b>

<blockquote>Whether they have been cleaned or not, injectors do not like to sit for extended periods of time without being run.  After servicing the injectors, they are flushed with a paraffin-based oil to protect them during <i>short term</i> storage.  If you will not be installing and running the injectors for several months, it's recommended that the injectors not be serviced until you are close to being ready to install and run them.</blockquote>

<b>Do you service diesel or mechanical injectors?</b>

<blockquote>No.  I only service electronic gasoline injectors.</blockquote>

<b>I am ready to ship my injectors for service.  What do I need to do?</b>
